Introduction and Update
0:00
what's up guys so in this video I want
0:02
to do a quick update on some stuff that
0:04
I've been doing over the past two weeks
0:05
so I took a break from YouTube for a
0:07
couple weeks to work on some personal
0:09
projects and I want to share some of
0:11
these projects with you specifically
0:13
I've done I did the like training course
O'Reilly Training Course Experience
0:16
for O'Reilly my first course doing my
0:19
first live training course for them and
0:21
it went amazing the light training was
0:24
about building text-based applications
0:26
with the judge TPI and link chain and I
0:29
mean we had over 275 attendees live and
0:34
I mean I got hundreds of questions great
0:36
feedback uh so it was just an amazing
0:39
experience and we're gonna do another
0:41
one in October on the 20th of October
0:45
and I'm Gonna Leave a link in the
0:46
description if you want to join that you
Research on Building LLM Agents
0:48
get and besides that I've been getting
0:50
in building LOL agents I've been
0:53
researching a lot about how to build llm
0:55
agents but not only that researching a
0:57
lot about the framers researching a lot
1:00
about how to formalize building agents
1:04
and understanding what the problem is
1:07
when we're kind of like attaching large
1:10
language models to tools and asking the
1:15
question okay how can I make this thing
1:18
do useful things reliably right this is
1:21
a really tough
1:22
it's a really tough thing to do and
1:27
um recently during my vacation I read
Overview of Autonomous AI Agents Paper
1:29
this 32 Pages paper on a survey for
1:32
autonomous AI agents again I'll leave a
1:34
link in the description essentially this
1:37
paper was really cool because it kind of
1:39
gave me like a perfect overview of
1:42
everything that's going on in research
1:44
regarding building llm-based agents and
1:47
I want to share a few of these insights
1:50
with you guys because essentially it's a
1:51
survey that just covers a bunch of stuff
1:54
from you know how to think about these
1:56
agents what research is happening right
1:59
now or all these types of problems types
2:02
of applications of agents and stuff that
2:04
people have been doing for example they
2:06
give one example inside the paper of a
Examples of LLM-based Agents in Research
2:10
chemistry researcher agent that
2:12
essentially was able to synthesize a new
2:14
molecule just using you know LMS plus
2:18
chemistry specific tools and I thought
2:21
that was one of the coolest Keepers I
2:23
think it's called Kim Crow I'll put a
2:25
link in the description for both the
2:28
survey paper and this chemistry agent
2:30
paper I thought it was amazing right in
2:32
this paper they talk about how you can
2:34
think about are the lens in terms of
2:35
these four basic components like a
2:38
profile so that's essentially how do you
2:40
kind of label what the agent is it can
2:43
be a researcher like a content creator
2:45
whatever you want
2:47
um and then they talk about okay so then
2:49
you can manually describe what the agent
2:52
is give it a profile like you're a
2:54
researcher your mathematician Etc or you
2:57
can have vanilla live the fine with the
2:59
agent is or you can do something called
Components of LLM Agents: Memory and Planning
3:01
data set alignment so the second
3:03
component it's is memory and you know
3:05
when you're interacting with llm agents
3:08
you needed to have some sort of memory
3:10
some sort of ability to hold information
3:12
from past experiences and they talk
3:16
about what are the challenges there you
3:18
know they talk about something like
3:19
unify and hybrid memory and the types of
3:22
formats of memory and the types of
3:24
operations that you have to do and they
3:27
go into detail about that so that was
3:28
cool so then they go into planning so
3:32
these agents need to plan out their
3:34
actions before right remember that most
3:36
of the like really high performing
3:38
agents to date are essentially based off
3:40
this paper called react which is I'm
3:43
going to leave a link in the description
3:44
for this paper as well and it's a
3:46
essentially it's a paper about you know
3:48
how an llm uh how to like get the best
3:52
out of vanilla them by just having it
3:56
um interpolated like just put
3:58
planning in actions kind of like one
4:01
after each other so that it gets the
4:04
best performance by just having it
4:06
having it like okay so this is what I'm
4:07
gonna do and then it does and then it
4:09
rethinks and then it goes and does again
4:11
I mean this is a really cool fundamental
4:14
paper so planning is a key component of
4:16
these agents and uh they they talk a lot
4:20
about strategies in planning and types
4:22
of feedback that you can get during the
4:24
planning phase like you can have just
4:26
the model plan out its own tasks and
4:28
then execute them or without any
4:31
feedback or you can have feedback for
4:33
the planning and the quality of the
4:34
planning that the model will Define for
4:36
itself
4:37
and finally you have the action space
Action Space and Strategies in Planning
4:40
which is actually they go into like
4:43
brilliant detail like this hierarchical
4:45
structure almost of a lot of stuff
4:48
related to how agents take actions in
4:52
the real world and essentially you know
4:54
you can have actions based off the tools
4:56
that the agents have right like
4:57
searching the internet uh searching
5:00
Google running code Etc but you can also
5:03
have actions based off the
5:05
self-knowledge of the agent
5:06
uh they go into a bunch of details about
5:09
like different things to think about for
5:11
example the action influence something
5:14
they call Action influence which is like
5:16
to analyze how a nation of an agent uh
5:19
has certain consequences certain you
5:21
know from when I do this what happens
5:24
what are the consequences to my action
5:26
for example if it does something on the
5:28
Internet what happens from there
5:31
stuff in that sense so that was kind of
5:33
interesting and I mean this paper is
5:36
full of cool stuff like for example
5:37
having tables for the benchmarks for
Challenges in Benchmarking LLM Agents
5:40
these agents because essentially
5:41
benchmarking llm agents today is like a
5:44
big problem because you know in essence
5:47
you have
5:49
um you don't have any kind of structure
5:51
right now any kind of framework or
5:52
protocol or how to evaluate the quality
5:55
of these agents and it's also very hard
5:57
because the tasks that these agents are
5:58
supposed to do are very general so it's
6:00
very subjective in a specific sense
6:03
however they do mention papers like
6:05
agent bench which is a paper that just
6:08
try to defy this protocol and framework
6:11
for how to properly evaluate llm agents
6:14
and it's kind of nice because they have
6:15
a bunch of tasks and they're within
6:17
those tasks you can see you know and you
6:20
have many different ways of evaluating
6:22
uh Carl Black's things like reasoning
6:25
and problem solving capabilities
6:27
so this paper is quite interesting and
6:29
it got me thinking about doing a few
Upcoming Projects and Researcher Agents
6:31
projects with these agents I already
6:33
started some and you guys are probably
6:35
going to see that in the very near
6:36
future essentially I want to build my
6:39
own researcher agents and you know the
6:41
different types of Agents related to
6:43
different things
6:44
and I think that would be a really cool
6:47
project to have in the channel
6:49
and the last thing was I've been getting
6:51
interested in La Machu which is the
Interest in Lamma 2 and Open Source Models
6:54
recently released open source model by
6:57
meta where essentially you have a model
7:00
that you know Rivals Church B team
7:02
performance but it's completely open
7:04
source and you can download it to your
7:07
computer and essentially you have a
7:09
large language model that can do
7:10
whatever set up a server in my new
7:12
workspace which is actually a great
7:15
segue to my next topic of discussion
7:18
which is I've been over the last month
New Workspace and Design Plans
7:22
and a half designing my new workspace I
7:26
kind of like I'm gonna assure you guys a
7:28
photo of what the space looks like right
7:30
now but it's actually just I have a
7:31
small office where I do the videos and
7:34
where I work and I want to change the
7:36
space to make it like not only better
7:39
for making YouTube videos but better to
7:41
work better to build stuff I've been
7:43
getting into electronics and you know
7:45
doing some kind of like you know maker
7:48
type projects so when I have a little
7:49
workshop inside my workspace
7:51
and this project has been really
7:54
interesting because it got me kind of
7:56
sketching a lot I've been trying to
7:57
learn how to draw for a while now and
8:00
I've been drawing kind of like I drew
8:02
out some designs for like the floor plan
8:04
of the workspace and it was really cool
8:07
because I've learned a lot about how
8:10
people in architecture designed their uh
8:14
you know do sketches for different
8:15
architectural designs and from that I
8:20
kind of like evolved to like more you
8:22
know slightly more formal floor Blends I
8:26
mean not really not really formal
8:28
because they they don't have like
8:30
specific measurements and stuff like
8:32
that but they're a little bit more like
8:34
structured and from that what I did was
8:37
I used a tool called relative Fusion
8:39
which I'll leave a link in the
8:41
description they're not sponsoring this
8:42
video by the way
8:43
and I really liked the video I really
Using AI for Rendering Floor Plans
8:45
like the tool because essentially it
8:47
allowed me to render
8:49
my sketches so I have these floor plans
8:53
and I rendered them with AI using they
8:56
use control net they had these they have
8:59
this really cool radio
9:01
2 if you guys don't know what radio is
9:03
it's a framework for like quickly
9:05
building a machine learning apps and
9:07
it's kind of like streamlit but it's
9:09
like you know uh simpler and um you know
9:12
runs in the browser just like
9:13
streamlined it's pretty cool
9:16
um and it was quite I had a great
9:19
experience doing these uh renderings of
9:21
the sketches because they gave me kind
9:23
of like a visual
9:24
even not 3D but kind of 3D visual of
9:28
what the workspace would look like
9:29
according to different settings for my
9:32
floor plan designs
9:34
and I think that was really cool I would
9:37
like to do a video on like how to use AI
9:40
like how to use open source AI
9:43
to do projects like that I think that's
9:45
a really cool kind of Avenue that we're
9:48
going with these things now in mid
9:50
Journey For example now you can do
Future of AI in Architecture and Design
9:51
sitting in the journey which is amazing
9:53
because you can you know generate
9:56
an image of like let's say uh like a an
9:59
office or a couch or whatever and then
10:02
you can select a small part within that
10:04
image of an office or a couch or
10:06
whatever and you can ask the model to
10:09
iterate on variations just for that
10:12
specific region that you selected
10:14
so there are a lot of tools for you know
10:17
architecture and design that I think are
10:19
interesting and I would love to see how
10:22
we can have you know free open source
10:25
you know available tools for the public
10:27
for you guys to interact with and use it
10:29
in your own workflows I mean that's just
10:32
my experience and I thought it was
10:33
really cool like I like this idea of
Channel Goals and Future Content
10:36
looking at how people learn and how
10:38
machines learn and just try to find the
10:41
intersections when we can build tools
10:44
that you know improve and augment Our
10:46
Lives I know it sounds kind of like
10:48
cliche and stuff but this is really the
10:50
goal of the Shadow and I want to keep
10:53
doing videos where I you know maybe in
10:55
the future I won't even do podcasts I'll
10:57
talk to people because my goal is to
11:00
have a place where you can go and it has
11:02
like the latest tools that you can use
11:04
to build something that helps you do
11:07
research it helps you do learning
11:10
and that's pretty much it this pretty
11:12
much covers what I've been doing lately
11:14
uh I'm working on some proposals for
Upcoming Training Courses and Conclusion
11:18
some new like training courses that I
11:20
want to do in the future so I'll keep
11:22
you guys updated all that all right
11:24
thank you guys for watching don't forget

11:28
time cheers
