Intro
0:00
all right so I live in Lisbon so what I
0:03
decided to do was I live in Lisbon which
0:06
is not exactly a huge town
Pope is coming to Lisbon!
0:10
okay so I live in Lisbon which is not
0:12
exactly a super big city it has
0:14
approximately three million inhabitants
0:16
and the pope is coming to visit on this
0:18
from the 2nd of August to the 6th and
0:21
that enlisted an increase in about a
0:24
million people who are going to be
0:26
coming to Lisbon to see the pope which
0:30
for me kind of ignited a bell of oh no
0:33
there's going to be a lot of people
The idea
0:35
everywhere so the programmer in me
0:37
looked at that and thought okay so how
0:40
can we automate staying away from the
0:44
hot spots where you know the pope might
0:46
visit so there might be like a bunch of
0:48
people there I decided to do a little
Explaining the automation
0:51
python automation that essentially helps
0:54
me keep track of
0:56
where the book is going to be and split
0:59
it by days so that I know the you know
1:02
areas to avoid when I'm walking around
1:05
Lisbon or you know going to town so what
1:07
I did was I copied all the itinerary
A walkthrough the code
1:10
from the pope from the official press
1:11
release and then I threw that into
1:14
charge BT to get some code to structure
1:17
that into a panda's data frame I didn't
1:19
did a little bit of cleaning and I
1:21
certified that all the locations that I
1:23
obtained for all the dates and the
1:25
timestamps were correct and associated
1:28
with the correct date and then what I
1:30
did is I used the geopy package to get
1:34
the coordinates the latitude and
The final product
1:36
longitude coordinates for each of those
1:37
locations separated by the bay and the
1:40
time when the pope is going to be
1:42
visiting those locations and then I
1:44
generated this really cool interactive
1:46
heat map of the city of Lisbon where you
1:49
can see the spots where the pope is
1:51
going to be and I have this very simple
1:53
interactive interface where I can click
1:55
on a date and then see the spots that
1:57
the pope is going to visit that day as
2:00
well as you know little lines connecting
2:02
those spots so that I have enough like a
2:04
small awareness of the region you know a
2:07
triangulation of the region where the
2:09
pope is going to be so I know which
2:11
places to avoid you know whatever which
2:14
day of the week when I'm going around
2:16
town I wanted to have this kind of like
2:18
holistic view so this ended up being a
2:21
very cool project to do and that's it if
2:23
